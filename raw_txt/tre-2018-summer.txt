UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS OFFICIAL NOTICE             Research Memorandum #314



              LIST OF TEACHERS RANKED AS EXCELLENT BY THEIR STUDENTS

                                      SUMMER 2018
                         (Based on Data Collected SUMMER 2018)



The results for the SUMMER 2018 administration of student ratings of
instructors are included in this list. Results are based on Instructor and
Course Evaluation (ICES) questionnaire forms maintained by Measurement and
Evaluation, Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning.

More than one-half of the faculty is estimated to have used student rating
forms, but a substantial number have not. Therefore, the report is
necessarily incomplete. Instructors who did not have students evaluate
their classes or chose to use a form other than those reported here have no
opportunity to be included. For some instructors who did use these forms,
there is also the possibility that they received ratings that were not truly
representative of their teaching ability. For these reasons, in the past we
adopted the title “An Incomplete List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by
Their Students.” These reasons still hold and the list is still
‘incomplete’ but we have taken “Incomplete” out of the title. The results
are presented in department alphabetical order. Criteria for inclusion
follows.

PREPARATION OF RESULTS

This list is based on ICES forms completed by students during the Summer
semester of 2018. Only those instructors who gave out ICES forms at least
once during this time period and who released their data for publication are
included in the list.

Only numerical data from the ICES questionnaire results were used, and at
least five students must have responded in each class.

Special Notice: In the past, to be included on the list instructors needed
to be rated among the top 30% across campus in their respective Elective-
Mixed-Required course group. Beginning with the Fall 2000 semester ICES
results, our office has shifted to a set of criterion cutoffs for the List.
Below are the ICES average (mean) results needed to make the List of
Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students. Faculty must meet the
requirements for both Item 1 (“Rate the Instructor’s Overall Teaching
Effectiveness”) and Item 2 (“Rate the Overall Quality of this Course”).
Teaching assistants must meet the requirement for only Item 1.

Outstanding ratings (marked with an asterisk) are still awarded to
instructors who obtained ratings of “High” (top 10% on each item for faculty
and top 10% on item one for teaching assistants).


INTERPRETATION OF LIST

Instructors' names are listed alphabetically within each department. The
specific courses that were used in the ratings are indicated by the course
numbers that follow the instructor's name.

      The symbols used in the list have the following meaning:

      T.A. - Teaching Assistant
         * - The instructor ratings were outstanding.



The list of excellent teachers was compiled by staff at Measurement and
Evaluation of the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning. More
information about the report may be obtained by contacting Measurement and
Evaluation, 247 Armory Building, 244-3846, ices@illinois.edu. Past lists
can be found on the Web at go.illinois.edu/lotrae.
